      paragraph: 'Lighting can create a mood, set the tone, and help to bring out the details in the image. For example, a "dystopian lighting" can give the audience a sense of an oppressive or bleak environment.'

      name: 'Color Grading',
      paragraph: 'The choice of colors can set the mood, evoke emotions, and create a certain atmosphere. For example, a "cinematic colorgrade" can give the audience a sense of a high-quality, professional-looking image.'

      name: 'Detail',
      paragraph: 'High levels of detail can bring the image to life and make it look more realistic. For example, a "highly detailed fabric" can give the subject a lifelike look and texture.'

      name: 'Chaos',
      paragraph: 'This term refers to the level of randomness and unpredictability in the image. A higher level of chaos can create a sense of unpredictability and action. Finally, you should think about how the final image will be presented. The aspect ratio, resolution, and quality can all impact the final image, and should be chosen based on the desired final outcome.'
